#### Abstract

Text-Trade is an iOS based mobile application that allows college students to buy and sell textbooks directly to each other. Our goal is to provide a place for students that has the sole purpose of getting them the textbooks they need for the fairest price possible. This will help not only the buyers of used textbooks, but also those that are looking to sell the ones they no longer need. The development of our project will use Xcode for the front end and Firebase for hosting the back end. Our project will use the databases of information provided by our users on who is looking for what textbooks and what textbooks are being sold to alert people when a book is available. Once a match has been found an alert will be sent to both users and they will be given the university email used to set up the account as a contact. This allows for a couple of things that are key to why our method is different than other existing used textbook markets. First, since you are required to sign up with a university email the only users that you could be interacting with are those that are also on your campus. This eliminates the need for shipping the textbooks or waiting for them to come in. Second, it ensures that the prices of the books are set by the students and only the students. Instead of the bookstore or another company telling you what your books are worth, you can decide what is fair and set your own prices.
